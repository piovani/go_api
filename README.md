# go_api's

This project is a collection of api types, using different packages and different ways, that I've been using and experimenting to understand more about the GoLang.

`Note`
```
The examples 1 and 2 do not advise looking, as they are more beginners and messier. I left them more as history.

## [Exemple 3](https://github.com/piovani/go_api/tree/master/example3)
This project was developed together with the Udemy course [Link](https://www.udemy.com/course/aprenda-golang-do-zero-desenvolva-uma-aplicacao-completa/).

The project is not exactly a thing, as it has some modifications of mine, due to my knowledge in a finished subject being greater than the presented one.

It's an api of a mini social network, with user registrations and publications.


## [Auth](https://github.com/piovani/go_api/tree/master/go_auth)
This project aims to understand the GoLang JWT package only.


## [External Request](https://github.com/piovani/go_api/tree/master/go_external_request)
Most api need information outside their scope, and to get this information it makes external requests to other APIs. And this project aims to show how an external request is made for other applications.


## [Mongo](https://github.com/piovani/go_api/tree/master/go_mongo)
This project aims to study the mongo driver for GoLang. As mongo is a very fast and widely used database for microservices, it makes perfect sense to study the interaction between these two technologies.


## [Gin](https://github.com/piovani/go_api/tree/master/go_gin)
This project aims to study Gin, a framework widely used in the GoLang community, it's just a simple API with a simple set of routes making CRUD.


## [Kafka](https://github.com/piovani/go_api/tree/master/go_kafka)
This project aims to study Kafka, consumer and posting messages on kafka topic.
